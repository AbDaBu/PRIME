What PRIME Is

PRIME is a structural system for stabilizing intent when working with AI. It exists to solve a specific problem: inconsistent results caused by unclear or shifting intent. Rather than focusing on better prompts, PRIME establishes a durable structure that makes intent explicit, reusable, and controllable across interactions, tasks, and modalities.

PRIME is not a prompt format. It is a pre-execution structure that governs how work is defined before any output is generated.

The PRIME Elements
	•	Perspective
Defines the human point of view. It captures priorities, standards, and constraints that determine what “good” looks like in this context.
	•	Role
Defines how the AI system should behave. It sets authority, scope, and posture so the system does not default to a generic assistant.
	•	Intent
Defines the required outcome. It is not phrasing or wording, but the result that must exist when the task is complete.
	•	Mandates
Define non-negotiables. These are constraints and boundaries that must hold regardless of how the task is executed.
	•	Examples
Anchor correctness. They show what “right” looks like when words alone are ambiguous, grounding output in concrete reference.

Each element exists whether it is defined or not. PRIME makes them explicit so the system does not guess.

How PRIME Is Assembled

PRIME is assembled by defining all five elements before execution. Perspective, Role, and Mandates are typically stable and reused across related work. Intent and Examples change as outcomes change.

Once assembled, PRIME remains intact even as wording, prompts, or execution methods vary. For complex work, multiple PRIME structures can be composed and sequenced, each handling a single decision or phase.

The result is consistent, controlled output driven by stable intent rather than repeated prompt revision.
